The idea was to grab one of the json data sets and play with it.  But, even though it looked like a json data set, and even quacked like a json data set, when I loaded it, it had extra spaces and characters.  This meant that using new obj1 = JSON.parse(jsondata) did not work.

I will see if one of the profs can figure out why on Saturday.
