# airplane

Please note that the program throws odd results if you don't update the JSON file so the flights leave on the day you run the program!  If you don't, the program sends out odd results like the plane left -7 hours ago and -23 seconds.  Clearly, I should have an IF (Date == ...) in the program, but that's for a later date.

But anyway, it was fun to see how complex it can be to manipulate time objects.
